# OpenFusionAPI
**OpenFusionAPI** uses Svelte as a framework for the frontend in conjunction with the adapter-node.

This makes development easier by creating reusable and reactive components.

To learn about Svelte you can visit the following [tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics).


If on the other hand you need to learn how to create APIs from the web interface you can find a detailed tutorial at [libapiserver](https://github.com/edwinspire/libapiserver).
