# OpenFusionAPI

**OpenFusionAPI** uses Svelte as a framework for the frontend in conjunction with the adapter-node.

  

This makes development easier by creating reusable and reactive components.

  

To learn about Svelte you can visit the following [tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics).

If on the other hand you need to learn how to create APIs from the web interface you can find a detailed tutorial at [libapiserver](https://github.com/edwinspire/libapiserver).

  # Tutorial
We consider that it is easier and more intuitive to show how to use the application in video.
We provide you with a list of videos that can help you create your own APIs in a simple way.
